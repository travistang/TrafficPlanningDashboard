A prototype of a dashboard visualizing transport-related algorithms.

## Instructions
- Left click on any location on the map to add a destination
- Right click on any location on the map to add a sink
- click "Compute solution" button to run a dummy algorithm that gives route to destinations and the first sink added alternatively.
- The resulting route is shown as blue lines on the map
- Details of routes "computed" can be found on the right hand side of the dashboard, so are the names of the destinations and sinks
